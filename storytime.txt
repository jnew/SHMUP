The year is 2177, and humanity has been at war for generations. 

Since the dawn of interstellar civilization, mankind has fought for their foothold in the galaxy. The sheer length and scale of the conflict has transformed human civilization. The discovery of hostile alien life united Earth, and massive technological and societal progress followed in its wake. 

Freed from petty domestic disputes, methods of waging war on an interstellar scale began to develop. Much to humanities' chagrin, early efforts were largely failures, and the human alliance suffered painful defeats.

In secret, the ruling human council ordered the construction of the greatest fighter ship ever conceived, the culmination of the prior 100 years of human ship building knowledge, codenamed CTRL+ALT+DSTRY. Of course, there was no question as to who would pilot this great machine: Captain Ace "SPACE" Pilot, the most skilled fighter in the Milky Way.

The mission was simple, but terribly dangerous: as the main human fleet bombarded the atmosphere of a neighboring star, our hero would deploy to the surface in search of a key weapons depot, and destroy it.

During the initial phases of the operation the alliance sustained heavy casualties, but managed to punch a hole in the enemies heavy atmospheric defenses.

You are Ace "SPACE" Pilot. Your story is legend, and you are the only one capable of ending this conflict. Your decent to the surface is almost complete, and there are hostiles on the horizon. Take the reins of CTRL+ALT+DSTRY, and finish the mission, soldier!
